This Forum Assistant website was created to replace the previous version, which was limited to registration only, hence I refer to this version as 2.0. It features functionalities such as practical assistant registration, assistant data management, attendance tracking, certification issuance, polling, assistant reporting, and more.\n\nPrimarily developed using Laravel, this website also incorporates several microservices built with Express JS and React JS. It operates on a VPS equipped with Docker and Jenkins. Initially, I developed this website independently with Laravel from version 2.0 to 2.1. However, for the version 2.2 update, I received assistance from my friend named Haikal. He primarily aided me with JavaScript and supported me in managing the server with Jenkins and Docker.\n",
